# Loadicator
This project was carried out in C++ as part of a course of the author's MSc degree.
Given the (a) trim and stability book, (b) sounding tables and (c) hydrostatic tables of a 174000 DWT double side skin bulk carrier, the code performs all necessary calculations to deduce the final hydrostatic equilibrium of the vessel for any loading condition.
That is, calculate the fore and aft draught, heel and trim of the ship, and export the results in .TXT format.
Further improvements can be implemented to increase accuracy; refer to the notes located in Loadicator.CPP.
